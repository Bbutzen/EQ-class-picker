# EQ-class-picker
I have played Everquest off and on since 2001, and if I have not found my next "home" on the last Time Locked Progression server
I try again in May on the latest TLP server. The biggest dilemna I face each year is what class to play, so I decided to write a 
very simple program that can help me make that decision. I eliminated some classes flat out, and weighed others as mentioned in the
comment at the beginning of the program. Having just finished a class at Indiana University Kokomo that included Javascript in it I 
decided to use that and a simple HTML page to output the results. Changing the classes and weights should be super simple to do for 
future uses or for anyone else to adapt to their play style.
